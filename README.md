Multi-Label Research Paper Classification
This project focuses on building a deep learning-based system to classify research papers into multiple relevant research domains using their titles and abstracts. Research papers often span across multiple fields, and identifying these fields can help in better organization, retrieval, and recommendation systems. The classification is performed using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and deep learning models developed in Python.

Problem Statement
The task is to develop a multi-label classification model that can accurately predict the research fields of a paper given only its title and abstract. Unlike single-label classification, each paper in this project can belong to multiple categories, such as Artificial Intelligence, Data Mining, Natural Language Processing, and more. This adds complexity and demands models that can handle semantic patterns and overlapping class boundaries.

Tools and Technologies Used
This project is implemented using Python, leveraging powerful libraries and frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning, Scikit-learn for evaluation metrics, and Pandas/Numpy for data handling. Development and experimentation were carried out in Google Colab for fast prototyping and Visual Studio Code for local debugging and modular coding.

Dataset Overview
The dataset used includes a collection of research paper metadata with titles, abstracts, and their associated multi-label annotations. Preprocessing steps involved text normalization (removing punctuation, lowercasing, stop word removal), tokenization, sequence padding, and converting labels into a binary matrix format using one-hot encoding suitable for multi-label classification tasks.

Deep Learning Models
Two types of models were developed and compared: LSTM-based and CNN-based architectures. The LSTM model leverages the sequential nature of text data to capture contextual word dependencies, making it effective for understanding the structure and meaning of abstracts. The CNN model, on the other hand, captures local phrase-level patterns and is computationally efficient. Both models start with embedding layers and are followed by dense layers for multi-label prediction.

Optimization Techniques
To improve the generalization and performance of the models, several regularization and optimization strategies were applied. Dropout layers were used to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping neurons during training. Batch normalization was applied to stabilize and accelerate training. Additionally, hyperparameter tuning was performed to find the optimal number of epochs, batch size, learning rate, and layer sizes. Early stopping was used to halt training when the validation performance stopped improving.

Evaluation Metrics
Given the multi-label nature of the task, a range of evaluation metrics were used to assess performance. These include Hamming Loss, Precision, Recall, and F1-score (both micro and macro averages). Subset accuracy, which measures the percentage of exact label set matches, was also used to evaluate the effectiveness of the model comprehensively.

Results and Insights
The LSTM and CNN models both showed strong performance in predicting relevant research fields, with variations depending on the abstract length and label complexity. The use of semantic modeling with LSTM slightly outperformed CNN in longer texts, while CNN worked well on shorter abstracts. Regularization techniques like dropout and batch normalization significantly improved the modelâ€™s robustness and reduced overfitting.
